## Story

The first version of Floorplan for Home Assistant dates back to 2017. The project was developed by [Petar Ko≈æul](https://github.com/pkozul) based on earlier work done using SVG files for home automation. With the ermergence of Lovelace in HA, Petar added support for running [ha-floorplan](https://github.com/pkozul/ha-floorplan) as a Lovelace card. The old Lovelace version was called [lovelace-floorplan](https://github.com/ExperienceLovelace/lovelace-floorplan). [Tobias Nordahl Kristensen](https://github.com/exetico) joined the ha-floorplan project during a period where not much development was taking place on the project. After contributing a huge pull request, lovelace-floorplan was finally able to support HACS. What Tobias didn't know, was that Petar had already commenced a complete rewrite of the code, this time using TypeScript. The intention was to improve performance, add new features, and bring Floorplan to a whole new level.

We (Petar and Tobias) moved lovelace-floorplan to a new team called [ExperienceLovelace](https://github.com/ExperienceLovelace). After a few weeks of testing and improvements to the new code base, we finally released the first version of the new [ha-floorplan](https://github.com/ExperienceLovelace/ha-floorplan) (Yep, that's the current one).

## Your imagination (almost) defines the limits

With [ha-floorplan](https://github.com/ExperienceLovelace/ha-floorplan), we finally have a module which allows you to create tons of things. Create an SVG, and map entities to it. 

The primary usage is floorplans, but you're able to create whatever you need. You're able to import a normal image to an SVG file, so it's possible to do many things with it. Therefore, kindly head over to our examples area if you're ready to see [ha-floorplan](https://github.com/ExperienceLovelace/ha-floorplan) in action.

There's plenty of ways of doing [formatting](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/markup/markup-html-tags-and-formatting/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/edit/master/docs/_posts/2013-01-11-markup-html-tags-and-formatting.md)), and the [helpers](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/helpers/), [layouts](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/layouts/) and [utility classes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/utility-classes/) are all awesome. Minimal Mistakes can be used free of charge, and can be posted with GitHub Pages - like our docs. We'd just like to give a big shout-out to [Michael Rose](https://github.com/mmistakes), for a great Jekyll theme. Thanks!
