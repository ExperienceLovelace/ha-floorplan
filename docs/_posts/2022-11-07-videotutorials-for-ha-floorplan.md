## Tutorials ready on YouTube
I've been working on getting videos ready for you, guys. And today I'm happy to announce that the first [three videos has been released on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5xKVw-BInX1phV-Tnjznwd2YG5mEOvWL), in the last couple of weeks.

I can't promise that I'll be pushing videos regularly, but I'll try to at least share a few more, before (possibly) changing topic on the channel from time to time.

## New service in ha-floorplan

I'll also like to mention that a new `execute` function has been added to the ha-floorplan service-list. We've also added a great example on [how to use browser_mod in a JavaScript-call](http://localhost:4000/ha-floorplan/docs/usage/#using-execute-with-browser_mod), where we use the `execute` service. The `execute` service was implemented, after one user asked for a [better way to pass entities to browser_mod](https://github.com/ExperienceLovelace/ha-floorplan/discussions/252).

Thank you for using ha-floorplan, and as always: Feel free to join our [community](https://github.com/ExperienceLovelace/ha-floorplan/discussions).
