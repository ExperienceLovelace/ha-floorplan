Hi.

Thanks for using ha-floorplan. We're always interested in new ideas, however, all things are done in our free-time. Therefore time spend on new features are very limited. 

Please note that hanging feature reqeusts will be closed at some point - there's a section for that, in the Discussion area.

Therefore, we'll ask you to think about:
- Are this possible to done manually, without new logics added to ha-floorplan itself? There's many options to do things by you own. Consider this approach if possible. We've a good "Discussions" section, you can use here on GitHub.
- Are the new feature relevant for many people, and therefore; Not just a very specific feature, which will only be useful for your current setup? It's always good to think about that, before requesting any new implementations. If you think it's more or less related to your own setup, I'd suggest you try and solve it on your own.

Cool! Now it's time to fill the required fields. You can remove this text-section :-)
